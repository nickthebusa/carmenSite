        <h3>Mobile Phlebotomy</h3>
        <p>
          Our Mobile Phlebotomy Services will draw your blood in the convenience of your own house.
          With our one stop solution, you’ll save valuable time. Our integrated approach streamlines the
          process. We handle everything from start to finish, once you have received your kit from the
          laboratory. Prices vary according to the request from the lab. The cost is determined by the
          scope of the services provided and can change accordingly. Travel distance and time also factor
          into this.

        <h3>Biofeeback Scan</h3>
        <p>
          Biofeedback scan. Why do we offer this? We want you to feel good! Biofeedback devices let
          your body choose what is impeding your health progress. The scan looks at toxic threats,
          environment, food and stress to help determine what is threatening your well-being. You can
          learn what is behind your symptoms and what you can do with your body to help get rid of it.
          Once again we can bring the scan to you. It is done in the privacy of your own home. It is
          conducted remotely. Once the scan is complete, you will receive a report of the findings and
          then a holistic wellness plan is recommended. It may include diet suggestions, supplements and
          lifestyle changes.
